                12 years later, I am surprised to come across it again, and that it remains unchanged.</p>

            I found out that it is a website
            made for the movie Space Jam
            (1996),and was used to promote
            the movie.

            It is a perfect storm of early Internet design elements, including frames, tables and garish animated gifs.

                    I do not feel as fascinated by the playful and funky design; I feel anxious instead.

                It looks like no one knew it was still up until 2010 when Jeff Ubelhor, a Reddit user, discovered it and
                posted it on Reddit that led to many page views and recognition from one of the designers. After that,
                Warner Bros tried to shut the site down but one of the original designers was still at the company and
                told
                them to turn it back on. It now stays up to be a part of web history.

            Since the website was made in 1996, the design team revealed that SpaceJam.con was actually a "nightmare" to
            build.
        </p>

        <p id="purple">
            "No one had really done web development to that point," says the site's creator Dara Lynn-Weiss. The team
            was
            met with a lot of resistance when trying to get the web address displayed on the movie poster.
        </p>

        <p id="purple">
            Given the limitations the designers had during that time, it is relatively unfair to compare the website to
            the
            ones we see now.

            SpaceJam.com is not bad, it's just different.
